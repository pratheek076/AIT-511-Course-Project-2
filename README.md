## Team Details
* **Member 1:** [Pratheek P] (MS2025010)
* **Member 2:** [Abu Talha] (MT2025703)

## Project Description
This project involves building machine learning models for two datasets:
1.  **Smoker Status Prediction** (Binary Classification)
2.  **Forest Cover Type** (Multiclass Classification)

## Repository Structure
* `data/`: Contains dataset files (excluded from version control).
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, preprocessing, and modeling.
* `models/`: Saved model files.
* `images/`: Plots and graphs generated during EDA.

## Instructions to Run
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Download datasets from Kaggle (links below) and place them in the `data/` folder.
4.  Run `notebooks/main_analysis.ipynb`.
